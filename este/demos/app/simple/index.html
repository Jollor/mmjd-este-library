  <h1>este.demos.app.simple</h1>
  <p>
      Simple app demostration. Do you know <a href="https://medium.com/joys-of-javascript/4353246f4480">pending navigations</a> pattern?
      That's why este app presenters are async by design. It's crucial for good
      UX.
  </p>
  <p>
      Try click to products/0, then before request is finished, click to
      products/1. First click will be canceled. Try several fast clicks on the
      same link. Only first click will be processed. Detail Presenter uses
      timeouts for slow connection simulation. products/0 is timeouted by 6s,
      others products by 2s.
  </p>
  <p>
      Default app timeout is 10s. Then timeout error is shown and user can
      repeat action. Loading errors are also detected. Both error and timeout
      are shown via window.alert by default. It can be disabled via showAlertOnError
      option.
